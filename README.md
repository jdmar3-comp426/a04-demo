# ao4-demo

Demo code for following along in a live session related to a04 on 2021-10-19.

## Topics

Today's live session is going to introduce REST APIs, CRUD, and interacting with a database.

This seems like a lot to put together all at once, but what is really happening is translation.
The same concepts/actions are described in different ways, but serve the same function.

This is why we call it an Application Programming INTERFACE.
We are creating the place where that interface happens.
